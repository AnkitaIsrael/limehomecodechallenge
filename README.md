## Goal 

An app that shows properties around a user location and the provision to book them.

The minimum requirements for the app are:
 - Make sure there's a list, which lets you see/find any property around your current location.
 - Make sure the user can select a specific property, and create a "fake" booking request.
 - Show the booking requests list with a public API.
